        <img src="CardinLe_Volleyball.jpg" alt="Cardin Le Volleyball"  width="250">
        <p><strong>VOLLEYBALL</strong></p>
        <p>I previously played for the George Brown Men’s Volleyball Team, but my passion for the sport began when I was 12 years old. Over the past 10 years, volleyball has given me countless amazing memories and experiences. Beyond the game itself, it has provided me with opportunities to grow—helping me build strong social skills and gain confidence in who I am as an individual.</p>
        <img src="CardinLe_PowerRangers.jpg" alt="Cardin Le Power Rangers"  width="250">
        <p><strong>POWER RANGERS</strong></p> 
        <p>Here is a image of me as a child with a power rangers cake. Power Rangers has been a huge part of my life and has shaped the way I see the world. Watching the Rangers fight evil and protect the innocent taught me the value of teamwork, courage, and perseverance. I was inspired by how they faced challenges head on, relied on each other’s strengths, and never gave up, no matter how tough the battle. These lessons have carried over into my own life, influencing how I approach obstacles, work with others, and strive to make a positive impact in my community. Power Rangers showed me that even ordinary people can make a difference, and that fighting for what is right is always worth it.</p>
        <img src="CardinLe_Fashion.jpg" alt="Cardin Le Fashion" width="250">
        <p><strong>FASHION</strong></p>
        <p>Fashion has always come naturally to me. Over time, I have developed an intuitive sense of style and a deep understanding of how colors, patterns, and silhouettes work together. I enjoy experimenting with different looks and finding ways to express my personality through clothing. Whether I am putting together a casual outfit or exploring more bold and creative styles, I approach fashion with curiosity and confidence. It is something I have grown into effortlessly, and I love how it allows me to showcase my individuality and creativity in a natural and authentic way.</p>
        <img src="CardinLe_Art.jpg" alt="Cardin Le Art" width="250">
        <p><strong>ART</strong></p>
        <p>This is a art project I previously worked on. While creating this poster, I was studying conceptual topics and wanted to challenge my ability to design a poster based on the theme "zeitgeist." I chose a "Japanese Super Sentai" film and created a piece that captures the lighthearted superhero mood of the movie.</p>
